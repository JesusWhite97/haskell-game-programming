# ZuriHac Starters

Here are some pointers to begin with:

* The [board game scaffold](https://github.com/keera-studios/haskell-game-programming/tree/zuriHac2018/examples/board-game-scaffold) is a good starting point for diving into game programming. It contains
  * a [game structure description](https://github.com/keera-studios/haskell-game-programming/blob/zuriHac2018/examples/board-game-scaffold/docs/game-structure.md) that shows how all our games are structured. Why you should read it? The document will tell you.
  * [tasks](https://github.com/keera-studios/haskell-game-programming/blob/zuriHac2018/examples/board-game-scaffold/docs/tasks.md) that can be used as starting points including theory and practice for building your own game.
  * [source code](https://github.com/keera-studios/haskell-game-programming/tree/zuriHac2018/examples/board-game-scaffold/src) and a [README](https://github.com/keera-studios/haskell-game-programming/blob/zuriHac2018/examples/board-game-scaffold/README.md) to run the board game scaffold.
* The [Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/keera-studios/haskell-game-programming/wiki) is full of information that hopefully helps you to start to write your own games. Unfortunately many links are broken, so feel free to clean this up or add new documentation (i.e., SDL2 examples---analogous to the existing SDL1 examples) or describe your first steps in writing a game or ...
* The [raindrops example](https://github.com/keera-studios/haskell-game-programming/tree/zuriHac2018/examples/raindrops) shows the use of wiimote.
* [Haskanoid](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/haskanoid/) is one of our android games. It uses functional reactive programming, can be played with various input devices (mouse, wiimote, ...) and can be compiled with SDL1 or SDL2. We added an [issue](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/haskanoid/issues/67) with a list of new game features that you could work on.

Confused? Something is not working? Or do you just want to talk with a haskell game programmer?
Search me (Christina) and we will sort things out. ;-)
